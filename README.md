First Day : 
     I learn about ML, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning..
     Tried to apply this movie recommendations model.

     ''' process I learn '''
     Installing packages like : scipy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn(sklearn - previously used this package)
     Downloaded a movies dataset..
          - loading movie data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
          - using Pandas to view the first 5 rows of the loaded data
     Then data processing
          - exploring dataset structure, selecting relevant features like genres and keywords
          - handling missing values, combining selected features into a single feature vector
     Convert text data:
          - using TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical feature vectors
          - transforming text data for effective representation in machine learning algorithms
     Calculte cosine similarity:
          - utilizing cosine similarity to assess textual content similarity between movies
          - determining the closeness of each pair of movies based on their features
     Generate movie name and match:
          - prompting the user for their favorite movie name
          - finding the closest match from the dataset for user input
     Finding similar movies:
          - identifying similar movies based on computed similarity scores
          - generating personalized movie recommendations for the user
     Building a movie recommendation system:
          - explored building a basic movie recommendation system using Python
          - utilized text data from movie titles and cosine similarity for recommendations
     Recommendation reason:
          - Recommendation systems enhance user experience and engagement
          - Tailored suggestions impact user satisfaction and retention positively
